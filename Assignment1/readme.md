# Assignment 1

Write a program that takes some data as string input. Then it tries to find a positive number x such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target, which is

0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Also print the time it takes to get this nonce value.
