In a first-past-the-post (FPTP or FPP; sometimes formally called single-member plurality voting or SMP; sometimes called choose-one voting for single-member districts,
voters cast their vote for a candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins (even if the top candidate gets less than 50%, which typically happens
when there are more than two popular candidates).

## Mechanism:

1. Owner of the contract <b>Ballot</b>) is called <b>Chairperson</b>. Chairperson deploys the contract by passing: <br>
<b>regduration</b> - how long does the registration continues in hours. Registration time begins as soon as the contract is deployed.<br> 
<b>voteduration</b> - how long does the voting continues in hours. Voting time begins as soon as <b>StartVoting</b> function is called. <br>
Only chairperson can give rights to voters - <b>rightToVote</b>, and only after that they can vote. <br>
Only chairperson can give rights to contestants - <b>rightToContest</b>, and only after that they can stand in election.<br>
When these functions are used, all voters and contestants registered till then get verified by Chairperson.
2. Voters can <b>register</b> themselves just passing their name and a true/false in <b>ascontestant</b> if they want to stand in election as contestant. If the time to register is over, register function doesn't work. <br>
3. Once a voter or contestant registers, they get added to the arrays - voters or contestants. (Note: Every contestant is also a voter so they exist in both the arrays)
4. <b>ShowContestantIndex</b> function gives the index of contestant by passing their name.
5. <b>vote</b> function does the main process - to vote by entering contestant's name and their respective index. <br>
Requirements: Voter and contestant must be verified. Voter hasn't voted yet. proposalIndex must match with contestant's name. Voting time hasn't crossed voteduration.
6. <b>WinnerName</b> function compares the total votes to each contestant to give the winner name.<br>
This can only be run by the Chairperson.
